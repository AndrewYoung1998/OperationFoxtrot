#Operation Foxtrot

Operation Foxtrot is an idea I had when a close friend who is a veteran, informed me about losing their therapist. This conversation got me thinking what if there was a platform that would help him find a therapist in his area much easier. At this same time my senior capstone was starting and this I thought was the perfect to start a fun project

## The tech stack
React for front end components and routing
<br />
CSS3 for styling
<br />
Node JS for getting all the therapist within the user's zipcode
<br />
Firebase for storing users and user information
